# Employee-Management-Project
A cpp project based on Classes and File handling allowing basic operation such as adding, modifying, deleting and displaying one or all employee records. Besides these, this project also allows users to print the salary slip for a particular employee. This project is large and I tried my best to make it error-free. 

Project uses following c/c++ concept

* Functions
* Classes
* File handling
* C++ Graphics
* Function overriding and overloading

## Project Operations

- Addition of New Employee:
This method is under the public functions of class employee. The information handled in this feature are employee code number, name, address, phone number, joining date (day, month and year), designation, grade and loan.

- Modify Employee Record:
Modifications that can be made are the employee code number itself, joining date (day, month and year), name, address, phone number, designation, grade, house allowance and loan given to the employee. Employeeâ€™s grades are categorized as A, B, C, D and E.

- Delete Employee Record:
Deletion is done of an employee record by entering the employee code. A confirmation message is asked stating whether the user really wants to delete the record from the file.

- Print Employee Salary Slip:
This feature too asks for the employee code; the employee code has been used to unlock or perform operations in many features of this payroll management system project in C++. 

- Display Employee Record:
Providing the employee code number, users can access all the provided information related to a particular employee. The employee record information displayed are the ones provided while adding a new employee record.

- Display List of Employees:
This feature displays the record of all employees added in file. The records are displayed in a tabular pattern containing information such as code name of the employee, phone number, date of joining, designation, grade and salary.

## Limitations
The interface is made keeping in mind the resolution of 640x480. The project is still under development and may have bugs at different stages.
